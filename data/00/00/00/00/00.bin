  |   The Swindle is a steampunk cybercrime caper about breaking into       |
  |   buildings, hacking their systems, stealing all their cash, and        |
  |   quickly running away again before the police show up.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   London, 1849. Scotland Yard will soon activate its breakthrough       |
  |   surveillance technology, 'The Devil's Basilisk'.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Its surveillance capabilities will be total, and your career as a     |
  |   master thief will be over.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Steal it, before that can happen.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   From the safety of your rickety airship, you can modify your thief    |
  |   with new skills, tools, and all manner of technological horrors to    |
  |   tackle the wealthiest and most secure buildings in London.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   All the buildings you'll be robbing are randomly-generated, so        |
  |   you'll never get the same level twice.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Have you got what it takes to pull off The Swindle?                   |
